# Biography

About me: I was born and raised in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. As an undergraduate student at Princeton University, I studied physics and worked on research projects in biophysics. In graduate school I switched fields to computer science and received my PhD from the machine learning group at Harvard University. At UBC, I teach computer science and data science. My official job titles are Assistant Professor of Teaching in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) and Option Co-Director of the [Master of Data Science Program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) (Vancouver). For a non-exhaustive list of things that didn't work out along the way, see my [CV of Failures](https://www.mikegelbart.com/files/cv.pdf).
