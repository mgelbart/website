# Biography

<!-- Hello! I am the ~40 trillion gut bacteria, plus some smaller number of human cells, collectively known as Mike Gelbart. -->

About me: I was born and raised in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. As an undergraduate student at Princeton University, I studied physics and worked on research projects in biophysics. In graduate school I switched fields to computer science and received my PhD from the machine learning group at Harvard University. After graduate school I joined the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia as an education-focussed faculty member. At UBC I was part of the team that created UBC's [Master of Data Science Program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/), where I taught courses and also served as Co-Director from 2018 to 2021. I am currently Principal of the [Vancouver Independent School for Science and Technology](https://www.visst.ca) (VISST), a STEM high school that I co-founded in 2022.

For a non-exhaustive list of things that didn't work out along the way, see my [CV of Failures](https://www.mikegelbart.com/files/cv.pdf).
