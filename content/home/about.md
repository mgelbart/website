# Biography

Hello! I am the ~40 trillion gut bacteria, plus some smaller number of human cells, collectively known as Mike Gelbart. I was born and raised in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. As an undergraduate student at Princeton University, I studied physics and worked on research projects in biophysics. In graduate school I switched fields to computer science and received my PhD from the machine learning group at Harvard University. At UBC, I teach for the Department of Computer Science and the Master of Data Science program.
