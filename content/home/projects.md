#### Professional Projects

- I posted recordings of my lectures from serveral UBC courses: [DSCI 572: Supervised Learning II](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmXHcz_53Q3KLISD8jydKjz41b9iqERC) (Jan-Feb 2020, 8 lectures), [DSCI 512: Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmXHcz_53Q02OsWy9IduQiSGUSnVGFhm) (Oct-Nov 2019, 8 lectures), [DSCI 511: Programming for Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmXHcz_53Q26aQzhknaT3zwWvl7w8wQE) (Sep 2019, 4 lectures), and [CPSC 340: Machine Learning and Data Mining](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmXHcz_53Q02ZLeAxigki1JZFfCO6M-b) (Jan-Apr 2018, 33 lectures).
- I oversee and contribute to the [UBC MDS blog](https://ubc-mds.github.io/).
- I created a [course on linear classifiers](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/linear-classifiers-in-python)	for [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com). To learners: before signing up for my course, please read [this article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup) in order to make an informed decision.
- I wrote [Rhomboid](https://github.com/mgelbart/rhomboid), a set of Python scripts used to deliver courses via GitHub. There is also a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgiaBS4uUk0).
- I was one of the developers of [Spearmint](https://github.com/HIPS/spearmint), a package for optimizing expensive functions using Bayesian optimization.
- I wrote some blog posts for the (now disbanded) Harvard Intelligent Probabilistic Systems group's [blog](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/front-page/blog/). My favourite is the post on [Compressing Genomes](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/compressing-genomes/), although the equations no longer render properly.
- I wrote [Embryo Development Geometry Explorer](https://github.com/mgelbart/embryo-development-geometry-explorer) (EDGE), an image processing software package for developmental biology.

#### Personal Projects
- Joel Fox and I created two puzzle games: [Line of Sight](https://joel-fox.itch.io/line-of-sight) and [Herding Hero](https://joel-fox.itch.io/herding-hero). My favourite puzzle games are [The Witness](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/) and [Portal 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/) (especially the co-op mode).
- I wrote [_The Magnum Opiate: a story of mystery, and intriguing_](https://github.com/mgelbart/magnum-opiate/blob/master/README.md#the-magnum-opiate-a-story-of-mystery-and-intriguing).
- [This time lapse video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfAIef4ibec) from 2011 demonstrates a new shaving technique that I developed. Photography and editing by Oren Rippel.
- I participated in a [Chinese speech competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQYibv7SFHw) as part of [Princeton in Beijing](http://www.princeton.edu/pib/) in 2009.
- I co-created [Youth Canada](http://www.youthcanada.ca), a database of enrichment opportunities and articles for Canadian high school students.
