#### Professional Projects

- I blog at the [VISST blog](https://visst.ca/blog) and previously the [UBC MDS blog](https://ubc-mds.github.io/) and [elsewhere](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/compressing-genomes/).
- I co-created the [Key Capabilities in Data Science](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs/key-capabilities-data-science) continuing education program at UBC. The interactive lessons associated with these courses are publicly available: see [Programming in Python for Data Science](https://prog-learn.mds.ubc.ca/) and [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://ml-learn.mds.ubc.ca/). 
- I created a new UBC course, [CPSC 330: Applied Machine Learning](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/tree/v2.0).
- I posted recordings of my lectures from several UBC courses: 
  - [CPSC 330: Applied Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmXHcz_53Q2BXsWviGgEqdlSHmfsjSzC) (2020)
  - [CPSC 340: Machine Learning and Data Mining](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmXHcz_53Q02ZLeAxigki1JZFfCO6M-b) (2018)
  - [DSCI 572: Supervised Learning II](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmXHcz_53Q3KLISD8jydKjz41b9iqERC) (2020)
  - [DSCI 512: Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmXHcz_53Q02OsWy9IduQiSGUSnVGFhm) (2019)
  - [DSCI 511: Programming for Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmXHcz_53Q26aQzhknaT3zwWvl7w8wQE) (2019)
- I was one of the developers of [Spearmint](https://github.com/HIPS/spearmint), a package for optimizing expensive functions using Bayesian optimization.
- I wrote [Embryo Development Geometry Explorer](https://github.com/mgelbart/embryo-development-geometry-explorer) (EDGE), an image processing software package for developmental biology.

#### Personal Projects
- Joel Fox and I created two puzzle games: [Line of Sight](https://joel-fox.itch.io/line-of-sight) and [Herding Hero](https://joel-fox.itch.io/herding-hero). My favourite puzzle games are [The Witness](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/) and [Portal 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/) (especially the co-op mode).
- I participated in a [Chinese speech competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQYibv7SFHw) as part of [Princeton in Beijing](http://www.princeton.edu/pib/) in 2009.
